**Credits**

This repository is a clone of [zhuxihao](https://github.com/zhixuhao)'s  original 
unet [implementation](https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet/).

This repository has considerably diverged from the original implementation hence the need
to distribute it separately. 

This decision was taken in part due to the relative inactivity of the original implementation which would have made
it harder to collaborate. Please take a look at the list of changes from the original implementation
[here]https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/unet/blob/master/changelog.md). 

The Unet algorithm was introduced by Ronneberger et al. in their 
[paper](http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/).
