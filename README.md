**IMPORTANT NOTICE**

It is important to first state that most of the code in this repository was 
originally written by [zhuxihao](https://github.com/zhixuhao). You can see the original implementation
[here](https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet/). At the time of writing, this was licensed under the MIT 
[license](https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet/blob/b45af4d458437d8281cc218a07fd4380818ece4a/LICENSE). 

**Why another repository and not a fork?**

I decided to turn this from a fork to an actual repository because I did not intend to create a pull request at the original
repository, mainly because the latter seemed fairly inactive.  

You can view my commits via Github or `git` as you may find convenient, in case you are curious.

Alternatively, take a look at the [change log](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/unet/blob/master/changelog.md) for a detailed list of 
changes from the original implementation. 

The **overall purpose of this repository** is to:
1. Extend the original implementation
 
2. Fix known issues at [zhixuhao-unet](https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet/issues)

----

**Installation**


To install:

```
git clone https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/unet.git

```

**Sample Usage**

The quickest way to get to speed with how the repository works is to take a look at the example notebooks 
in the examples [folder](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/unet/blob/master/examples).


**To raise an issue or question**



You can either raise issues here or at zhixuhao's repo. I monitor the latter for new issues although I am not in any 
way part of the original development.
